Most games use the "tkinter" interface and the "pygame" library to create games with Python.

#Python game code for Android

Users may have a question whether it is possible to make an Android game with Python?
The answer to this question is yes, and there are several ways to achieve this goal, i.e.
making games with Python for Android:

*Kivy: Kivy is an open source Python library designed for developing multi-touch applications and can be used to build Python games for Android.
This Python library supports different platforms including Android. 
With Kivy, you can create games and other interactive applications using Python.

*Pygame: Pygame is a popular platform for the Python modules designed to write video games.
While this library is not for Android development, you can use tools like Pygame Subset for Android (PGS4A) to pack your Pygame -based game for the Android platform.

*Renpy: If you are interested in creating interactive storytelling games, Renpi is a visual game engine that uses the Python script.

*SL4A (Scripting Layer for Android): SL4A is an open source project that allows you to run scripts and interpret different programming languages ​​on Android devices.
The platform supports Python, and while it's not primarily designed for game development, you can use it to create simple games.
