This is the step-by-step description of this Python code for making the game:

Step 1: Game Setup:

Open your Python editor or IDE of choice (eg, Visual Studio Code, PyCharm, IDLE).
Create a new Python file and save it with a meaningful name, such as "py".

Step 2: Import the required libraries:

Since this is a text-based game we won't need any external libraries, so there's no need to import any libraries.ðŸ˜Ž

Step 3: Define the game function:

  import random

  def guessing_game():
    print("Welcome to the Guessing Game!")
    lower_bound = 1
    upper_bound = 100
    secret_number = random.randint(lower_bound, upper_bound)
    attempts = 0

 while True:
        attempts += 1
        user_guess = int(input(f"\nGuess the number between {lower_bound} and {upper_bound}: "))









# Simple pygame program

# Import and initialize the pygame library
import pygame
pygame.init()

# Set up the drawing window
screen = pygame.display.set_mode([500, 500])

# Run until the user asks to quit
running = True
while running:

    # Did the user click the window close button?
    for event in pygame.event.get():
        if event.type == pygame.QUIT:
            running = False

    # Fill the background with white
    screen.fill((255, 255, 255))

    # Draw a solid blue circle in the center
    pygame.draw.circle(screen, (0, 0, 255), (250, 250), 75)

    # Flip the display
    pygame.display.flip()

# Done! Time to quit.
pygame.quit()
