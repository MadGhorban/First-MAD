This is the step-by-step description of Python code for making a simple game:

Step 1: Game Setup:

Open your Python editor or IDE of choice (eg, Visual Studio Code, PyCharm, IDLE).
Create a new Python file and save it with a meaningful name, such as "py".

Step 2: Import the required libraries:

Since this is a text-based game we won't need any external libraries, so there's no need to import any libraries.ðŸ˜Ž

Step 3: Define the game function:

  import random

  def guessing_game():
    print("Welcome to the Guessing Game!")
    lower_bound = 1
    upper_bound = 100
    secret_number = random.randint(lower_bound, upper_bound)
    attempts = 0

 while True:
        attempts += 1
        user_guess = int(input(f"\nGuess the number between {lower_bound} and {upper_bound}: "))

if user_guess == secret_number:
            print(f"Congratulations! You guessed the number {secret_number} in {attempts} attempts.")

break
        elif user_guess < secret_number:
            print("Try again! The secret number is higher.")
        else:
            print("Try again! The secret number is lower.")

Step 4: Implement the game loop:

def main():
    while True:
        guessing_game()
        play_again = input("\nDo you want to play again? (yes/no): ")
        if play_again.lower() != "yes":
            print("Thank you for playing. Goodbye!")

 break

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()

Step 5: In this step of learning how to make a game with Python, it is time to run the game.
For this purpose, the following steps should be followed:

*Save the Python file and run it using your Python interpreter.
*The game window will open showing a green snake on a white background.
*Use the arrow keys to control the snake and try to eat the black food.
*The snake grows longer with each food it eats, and it's game over if the snake hits the boundaries or itself.










# Run until the user asks to quit
running = True
while running:

    # Did the user click the window close button?
    for event in pygame.event.get():
